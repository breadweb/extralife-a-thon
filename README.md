# ExtraLife-A-Thon

## About

The ExtraLife-A-Thon is a simple web application that Extra Life participants can use to support their fundraising efforts. It is a count down timer that is extended every time a participant's total amount raised increases.

The primary use case to be added to an OBS scene as a browser source for inclusion in a LIVE stream on Twitch, YouTube, or TikTok.

The implementation is intentionally simple so it can be modified and styled however desired.

## How to Use

1. Download the files from the `src` directory to a local directory on your computer.
2. Edit the settings at the top of the the `index.html` file.
3. Add to the `index.html` file to OBS as a browser source.
